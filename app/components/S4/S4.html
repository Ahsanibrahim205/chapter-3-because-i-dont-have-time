                    <h1>What’s Your<em> Optimal Time?</em></h1>
                </div>
                <p>You may have a surplus of energy, but you may not have it at the times you need it. Many people make the mistake of tackling the things that they have to do on the basis of urgency. They fail to take into account that there are times of the day when they are better able to take on certain types of tasks as opposed to others. As the sun progresses from the Eastern horizon to the West, so are our bodies changing. When we first get up in the morning, we have a large amount of the chemical that mobilizes energy. This chemical is called cortisol; and, as the day goes on, the levels gradually drop, bottoming out at about 3:00 in the morning, a time when most people normally are asleep. It then rises when we get out of bed, providing us with the energy we need to make it through the day. There are also ultradian rhythms. As opposed to a circadian rhythm, which means about the day, ultradian rhythms mean within the day. One of the best characterizations is the constant shifting in brain dominance.</p>
                <br>
                <p>You’ve undoubtedly heard of the left versus right-brain. The left-brain is primarily responsible for language and analytical skills. The right-brain, however, is involved more with artistic pursuits. Creating sculptures, music awareness, and music expression depend more upon neurons based in the right hemisphere. Every 90 to 110 minutes, you switch. For part of the day, the electrical activity on one side of the brain is more pronounced than it is on the other.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Have you ever found yourself in the middle of a task, where you are in what psychologists would refer to as ‘flow’ or, in athletics, ‘the zone’? You are doing what you need to do almost effortlessly, and it seems as though you could go on forever. Your performance is flawless. The clay is literally coming to life in your hands as you create the piece of art. But, then you take a short break. You return to the task, and now the clay literally crumbles in your hands. Or, the report that you had been writing with very little effort now is impossible to resume. A contributing factor could very well be that you have switched from the side of the brain that would facilitate accomplishing this task. Writing a report depends upon language. That’s a left-brain function, while creating a sculpture would require the right.</p>
                <br>
                <p>What you need to do is select the time of day when you are most likely to be able to complete the task at hand. If it requires a certain amount of energy and physical exertion, then select a time of day when your glucocorticoids will be elevated, for example, the morning. If it’s a language-based task, then select a time of day when you are more likely to be in your left-hemisphere as opposed to your right. No, you do not need sophisticated electronic equipment to determine in which side of the brain you are operating. You very well may be able to determine this by doing the following nasal exercise.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Take a deep breath through your nose. Now do it again, and pay attention through which nostril you are breathing. Obviously, you are probably breathing through both simultaneously; but, if you pay very careful attention, you’ll notice that the air is passing more readily through one side as opposed to the other. What facilitates the passage of air is constriction of blood vessels on that side. The more constricted the blood vessels, the more readily air will pass through the corresponding nostril. Vascular constriction is controlled by the autonomic nervous system. Unlike other components of the nervous system, the autonomic nervous system does not cross over. What’s happening on one side of your body is happening in the same side of your brain. If the air is passing more readily through your left nostril, that means that the blood vessels are not only maximally constricted in your left nostril, but they are also maximally constricted in the left side of your brain. There’s going to be relatively more blood flow in the opposite hemisphere. What is the translation of this information? Quite simply, you are in the side of the brain opposite to the nostril that you are breathing through. Just as your electrical activity shifts from one side of the brain to the other in an ultradian type of fashion, so does the ease with which air passes through your nostrils. After you have established which nostril you are breathing through most readily, try it again in about an hour. Chances are, you will have switched.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I realize that this sounds like a rather unscientific approach, but the phenomenon is real. You cannot dispute data, just their interpretation. A number of studies have documented that the switch from the left side to the right does, indeed, occur. Whether it is due to subtle changes in vasoconstriction is not absolutely clear. Regardless of the mechanism whereby the switch is taking place, the fact that changes in the brain occur has been known since antiquity in India. Hunters recognized that there were certain times during the day when they were less likely to be successful as compared with others. They determined when that time of day was on the basis of which nostril they were breathing through.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It’s 10:00 AM; and at 11:00 AM, you have to have a very important report on your supervisor’s desk. You have just switched over, and you are now breathing through your left nostril, which means, of course, that you are in your right-brain. This is not the best side of the brain to be in if you want to achieve flow while writing a report. You need to be in your left-brain, which is where language is based; and that, in turn, means that you should be breathing more readily through your right nostril. Some people claim to be able to shift their dominance by forcing themselves to breathe through the nostril that they need to be breathing through. By holding your nostril and forcing yourself to breathe through one or the other, it is possible to shift the dominance profile. There are even a few scientific papers documenting that this can be achieved under laboratory conditions, as well. Whether it will work for you is something that you will have to find out.</p>
