                            <h1>Use Your <em>Time Efficiently</em></h1>
                        </div>
                        <p>Everyone needs to have objectives that they want to achieve in order to give their life purpose. Whatever the dream happens to be, it has to be realistic and something you truly want -- not something you are doing just to please other people. Did you know that just thinking about a goal or writing that goal down will help facilitate your accomplishing it? Once you've identified what it is you want to achieve, it becomes easier to identify the information and circumstances that will help you achieve that goal.</p>
                        <div class="text-content">
                        	<div class="section-heading">
                        <ul>
                        	<li>Here are the ground rules:
                        		<br>
                        		<br>
                        		<ol>
                        			<li><b>Divide Projects into Manageable Components</b>: Break your goal into smaller and more manageable component parts. The reason is quite simple. When you focus upon the endpoint, it may seem as though the project is overwhelming. If you want to write a book, it may be very difficult getting the motivation to begin because you feel that you couldn't possibly accomplish such a goal. But no one has ever written a book. Instead, people write words, which come together as sentences, which come together as paragraphs, which, in turn, become chapters. It’s also a way to organize your time in the most efficient way possible.</li>
                        			<li><b>Don't Always Set Time Limits</b>: Most of the time, I recommend that you set a time during which you need to accomplish a particular goal. It might be within a certain number of days, weeks, or, perhaps, months. The reason is because setting deadlines provides structure, which many people need. Be careful, though. If you fail to accomplish your goal within that defined time frame, you may end up reinforcing your belief that you are a failure. Set the goal, but impose a time limit only if it is needed to help you maintain focus. Sometimes, it doesn't really matter when you complete the task.</li>
                        		    <li><b>Don't Always Set Time Limits (continued)</b>: Whether your goal is to lose weight or to create a piece of art, you are still a success as long as you are making progress. It may not always work when responding to the demands of your boss; but, if there’s no need to impose a time constraint, then why add to your anxiety?</li>
                                    <li><b>Don't Over-Publicize Your Goal</b>: Some professionals recommend that you tell others about your objectives to provide the additional motivation you might need in order to see the task through to completion. Of course, you want to share your goal with those people who will be affected by it. Furthermore, many people benefit by having a ‘buddy’ with the same goal. I’m advising against making prominent, public announcements. Why set yourself up for public embarrassment if you fail to accomplish your objective? It’s just not necessary. In fact, it may encourage others to badger you, especially if you're trying to lose weight. At the next office party when you reach for that extra piece of cake, you are inviting people to remind you of all the calories you are putting into your mouth. Instead of subjecting yourself to public scrutiny, go about achieving your goal, and wait for others to notice that you've shed a few pounds or that your clothes fit better. That's a much better way to do it.</li>
                                    <li><b>Dealing with Psychological Barriers</b>: If you are a person who sets a goal, but you never seem to accomplish it, consider the possibility that the reason is not because you don't have the necessary skills to organize your time. Perhaps, instead, you are running into some hand-me-down beliefs. You may have been criticized as a child and told that you were not capable of doing certain things. Or, that you would never amount to anything because every one of your ancestors was totally incompetent when it came to working with their hands, for example. If a parent or some other authority figure instills negative beliefs such as these at an impressionable age, they easily can become self-fulfilling prophesies. Furthermore, beliefs about oneself don't change overnight. Sometimes, the most important, first step in achieving a particular objective is to change the way you see yourself and to start believing that you do have the ability to achieve your dreams.</li>
                                    <li><b>Do It for Yourself</b>: Make sure that the goal you set is truly your goal and that what you're doing is not intended simply to please someone else. It might please others, but that should not be the primary motivation. I've taught students in medical schools for the past 20 years, and I've lost track of the number of students who really didn't want to be doctors. They were struggling to get good grades and to achieve that objective because it was what their parents wanted. They would reach a certain point in their training, and, suddenly, they would realize that they were not pursuing their own dream, but someone else's. Then, after having invested, maybe, ten years of their life in achieving this goal, they felt stuck with no alternative but to complete it. Recently, a former student who is now a successful doctor contacted me about how to start a new profession as a motivational speaker. Despite all the trappings of success, he can’t enjoy life because his goals have been inconsistent with his values. Alternatively, you might define a particular goal because you want to impress a specific group of people. . Ironically, those people may not be the least bit concerned about your personal happiness; yet, you are trying to impress them. In the process, you sacrifice your own development as a person.</li>
                                    <li><b>Be Flexible</b>: When setting about to pursue a dream, be flexible. If you have set life-long goals, then you need to review these at least once a year to see if the goals you felt were important when you were in your 20’s are still important to you in your 40’s. You may have new responsibilities, health problems, or other considerations that limit what is realistic for you to accomplish. So, on a regular basis, subject your goals to re-assessment in much the same way that you subject your beliefs to re-analysis. Answer these questions:
                                    <br>                        
                                    <p>Are your goals new, or did you formulate them years ago but have yet to achieve them? If the latter, why have you been unable to make more headway?</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Do you have too many goals and insufficient time to spend working towards them?</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Have you wasted time and effort on objectives that had nothing to do with your lifelong goals?</p>
                                    <br>
                                    <p>Are your values mirrored in the steps you take to achieve your objectives?</p></li>
                                </ol>
                        	</li>
                        </ul>     
                        </div>
                        </div>    
                        <br>
                        <p>Reflecting on the answers to these questions will shed considerable light on the changes you might need to make in order to begin making progress. If you don’t remove hidden obstacles to achieving your goals, positive steps can be discouragingly slow.</p>
