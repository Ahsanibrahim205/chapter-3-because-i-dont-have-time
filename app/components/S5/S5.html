                        <p>Much has been written about the tidal-like movement of estrogen and progesterone, which gives rise to physiological and, sometimes, mood changes in pre-menopausal women. But men experience changes associated with fluctuations in testosterone. They can influence performance and feelings on a daily, monthly, annual, and lifetime basis. Coaches and athletes are certainly aware of this. Even in the absence of any identifiable factor, there are times when athletes drop into a performance slump. Most likely, it is due to changes in the anabolic steroid, testosterone. This classic male hormone not only drops the voice an octave or two, but it also can be converted into estrogen. Thus, men also may be subject to mood changes.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Testosterone can fluctuate during the day. It’s normally highest in the morning and then drops at around bedtime. Superimposed upon this diurnal rhythm are mini-cycles that take place over a period of 15 to 20 minutes – approximately the interval that some men claim to fantasize about sex. Levels are also more likely to be higher during the fall and prior to the age of 40. Afterwards, there’s an approximately 10 percent decline with each, subsequent decade. Of course, levels of stress, exercise, and diet may impact the rate of change. For some men, these variations may be so subtle as to be inconsequential. For others, they may explain noticeable changes in both mental and physical abilities. How can you find out? Try this:</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Keep a detailed diary. Record everything that happens pertinent to what you want to accomplish. Do you want to find out why you zone out every day between 3:00 PM and 4:00 PM? Or how you can anticipate in advance those moments when everything you do works out just the way you wanted? Are you in a certain state because of conditioning? Are hormones running the show? You need to track everything, especially diet and time of day. Any rhythmicity would suggest a biological factor.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>If something happens seemingly at random or correlated only with certain events, chances are it’s an environmentally-induced phenomenon. Eventually, you will study each page to determine if there are any consistent correlations. Then, using these data, pick the optimal time to do those things you need to accomplish</p>
